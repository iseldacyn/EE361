The error in Prof. Hou's algorithm occurs in the second 'replace' operation. Prof Hou was mapping the two most common letters, 'T' and 'A', to the two most common in the cipher, 'l' and 'h' respectively. However, Prof. Hou accidentally replaced 'b' with 'A', rather than 'h' with 'A'. Later, when trying to replace 'b' with 'N', nothing changed since 'b' had already been replaced with 'A', incorrectly. Hence, instead of printing words such as 'THEN' or 'THAT', they became 'THEA' and 'THhT'. If 'h' had been replaced by 'A' instead of 'b', then the cipher would have worked correctly.
